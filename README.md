## Spotify Scraping, Data Exploration, Visualization \& Bootstrapping

In the .ipynb available above, I have compiled and explained four scripts I wrote in Python (with some SQL functionality) to study, explore, and test public Spotify streaming data. They were written in late 2019, but I used them to recompile data for 2020 and re-evaluate my bootstrap experiment with this year's data.

Makes use of BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TKCalendar, and bootstrapping techniques.

Thank you for checking out my work!
